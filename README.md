## Introduction üññ
This Package offers a simple way to get Countries, Cities and States that you may need for your Application, most especially for dropdown menus.

### Step One - Install via Composer üéº

Require the package via composer into your project

```shell
composer require bdhabib/laravel-location
```

![composer install](https://res.cloudinary.com/ichtrojan/image/upload/v1557601533/Screenshot_2019-05-11_at_8.04.49_PM_ojixaa.png)

### Step Two - Publish Configurations ‚öôÔ∏è
Laravel location provides you with an easy way of customizing the tables used for storing Countries, States and Cities. Also, you can customisethe route prefix and middleware. To customize these you need to publish the 
configuration file. To publish the configuration file, run:

`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-location`

You will have `config/location.php` available for you to edit. The default configurations are:

```php
<?php

return [
    'countries_table' => 'countries',
    'cities_table' => 'cities',
    'states_table' => 'states',
    'routes' => [
        'prefix' => 'location',
        'middleware' => 'web'
    ]
];
```

You can go ahead and customize the `table names`, `route prefix` and `middleware` as you need before running the Migration.

### Step Three - Running Migrations

> before you do this make sure your correct Database credentials are set in the `.env` file

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

Finally, run the Package seeders

```shell
php artisan db:seed --class=Bdhabib\\Location\\Seeds\\LocationDatabaseSeeder
```
